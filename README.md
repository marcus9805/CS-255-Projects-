# CS-255-Projects-

1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? - The client was DriverPass, a company that offers online and in-person driving education services. The type of system they wanted to be designed is a learning management and scheduling system.

2. What did you do particularly well? - I feel like I did well with identifying each way every user will interact with the system.

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? - I probably would have taken more time to revice the diagrams I created to make them more detailed

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? - Found the biggest pain points like scheduling lessons etc and made sure that these needs were directly addressed in the system's features.

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? - Primarily by starting with the user needs and owner goals. Then use those to move into the functions and system modeling with use case diagrams. In the future I would do earlier wireframes and more interviews with the users and owner.
